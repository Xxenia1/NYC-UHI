# Urban Heat Island & Social Equity in New York City (2025)

## Abstract
This project investigates the intersection of **urban heat island (UHI)** effects and social equity in New York City during the summer of 2025.  
By integrating remote sensing data, socio-economic indicators, and historical planning legacies, the project identifies **spatial patterns of heat exposure**, assesses **vulnerable populations**, and proposes **equitable urban planning strategies**.

## Objectives
- ➤ Map current UHI intensity (Summer 2025) across New York City.  
- ➤ Analyze equity dimensions by overlaying LST with socio-economic indicators (income, race/ethnicity, age, housing).  
- ➤ Case study of extreme heatwaves (e.g., July 2025) to illustrate neighborhood-level disparities under extreme conditions.  
- ➤ Assess long-term trends (2010–2025) in urban heat and social vulnerability.  
- ➤ Provide policy recommendations for equitable climate adaptation (tree planting, cool roofs, cooling centers).

## Main Research Questions
- ➤ Which NYC neighborhoods are the hottest in 2025, and how does this overlap with vulnerable populations?  
- ➤ Are historically marginalized areas (e.g., formerly redlined neighborhoods) disproportionately exposed to higher temperatures?  
- ➤ How do extreme heatwave days in July 2025 exacerbate inequities?  
- ➤ What interventions (tree canopy, cool roofs, cooling centers) could mitigate these inequities in the future?  
- ➤ Has inequity in heat exposure persisted or shifted between 2010 and 2025?

- ACS 2020-2024 income, race, housing, age
- NYC Open Data: tree canopy, impervious surfaces, zoning
- HOLC Redlining Maps (1930s)
